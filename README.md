# Loan-System-GDG
This problem comprises with the data of several features of data for Data Processing and to make predictions and download the dataset comprises of id,loan_status 
where predictions are made upto 0 to 1.
-->I have preprocessed the data.
-->I have choosen the algorithm of GradientBoostingClassifier..
      *)The first decision tree is trained, and it makes predictions.
      *)The algorithm calculates the errors (residuals) between the actual target values and the predicted values.
      *)A second decision tree is trained on these errors (residuals).
      *)This process is repeated multiple times, each time adding a new tree to correct the previous errors.
      *)Finally, all the trees are combined to make the final prediction, either a binary class (0 or 1) or a probability.
-->And finally,I have taken id,loan_status make them as Dataframe Downloaded the csv format of file submission.csv
